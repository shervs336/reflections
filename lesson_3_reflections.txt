Q: Would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I would rather create a remote repository, to have a backup of my work. At the same time, it
    really helps me share my work with my co-workers.
   
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:	To avoid conflicts with others files if there are changes or different files.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are for cloning repository to another one. Clones are cloning repository on local PC or local PC to PC.
	Branches replicates master branch and creating seperate version of the code.
